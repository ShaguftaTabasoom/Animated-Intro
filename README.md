# Animated-Intro
A cinematic 3D animation intro created using Blender and After Effects. This project  focusing on modeling, animation, lighting, and post-production techniques. It is designed to enhance my animation workflow skills and explore storytelling through visual effects.

# Overview
This project is a recreation of the intro sequence from my favorite movie, created using Blender and After Effects.
The goal was to practice 3D animation, modeling, texturing, lighting, and compositing techniques while developing a cinematic sense of timing and visual storytelling.

# Tools Used
Blender — for 3D modeling, animation, texturing, and lighting
After Effects — for final compositing, adding visual effects, and post-production

# Challenges Faced
Achieving realistic lighting and shadows to match the original mood
Synchronizing camera movements with animated elements
Managing render times and optimizing scene complexity

# Solutions
Studied real-world lighting references and practiced light baking
Used Blender’s graph editor to fine-tune camera animation curves
Applied render optimizations like simplifying materials and enabling denoising
